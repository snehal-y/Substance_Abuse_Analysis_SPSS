# Substance_Abuse_Analysis_SPSS

The dataset is from the ICPSR (Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research). This dataset focuses on typical behaviors of 8th and 10th graders from 2012-2017. This project has a plan to probe and analyze this dataset to try and pinpoint the causes and variables that are causing adolescents to turn to drugs and alcohol. Our primary objective is to use the findings of our research to aid government agencies in coming up with more efficient methods of preventing drug and alcohol use amongst adolescents.

After some initial reduction of the datasets, following KPIs are observed:

How does the D.A.R.E program help kids interpret the risk of smoking?
How does drug use influence adolescents’ school performance?
What is the likelihood of alcohol usage based on adolescent’s emotional state (depressed vs. happy) and the presence of a parent?
